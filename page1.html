        <h1>The 4 Representations</h1>
        <p>
          In here, I will talk about 4 particular websites that match the
          contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. These are the 4
          essential web design principles.

        <h1>Contrast</h1>

            <li>
              A glimpse of what the website offers. An example of contrast.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notable colors of green, different shades of pink and purple, as
              well as the white for smokes and parts of the buildings make their
              website stand out with its colors. <br />
              That's just one small part of their website.
            </li>
            <li>
              The logo and its colors are personally my favorite on their
              website.

            <h3>
              A website that I think is a good example of repetition is Tsuki.
              Image shown is from a cellphone, and it may not be a good preview
              of what their website looks like, but you'll see what I mean when
              you visit their website.
            </h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Tsuki is simple and straightforward to navigate on, with 2 logos
                on each side, as well as the images seen at the center. 4 images
                having shown with the same sizing for repetition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sign of repetition with the image sizing doesn't end there, as
                navigating to their collection leads you to their products for
                sale. They are also aligned evenly on their organization of
                products, with the help of grids. <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, they will also show a repetition of design and
                alignment for their categories on the collection. This makes
                their website easy to look at and distinguish categories from
                their grid of products.
              </li>

            <dt>Bron Bron Land?</dt>
            <dd>
              - You heard that right. Bron Bron Land. This is an example for
              Proximity, mainly because of how the website makes you go through
              Lebron's history.
            </dd>
            <br />
            <dt>What do you mean by that?</dt>
            <dd>
              - The website starts you with showing the whole Bron Land, then
              you click or scroll from the "Start" area. <br />It zooms in and
              practically gives you a tour, going around Bron Bron Land. <br />
              As it moves you around the land, you also get a text to read from
              the left side of the screen, as you take a closer look at the Bron
              Bron Land.
            </dd>
            <br />
            <dt>
              So as you proceed through each tourist spot of Bron Bron Land, you
              get a glimpse of Lebron's history?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              - Essentially, yes. While you're given a block of text on one side
              of the screen, it is not too big to keep you engaged on the visual
              side. <br />The proceeding tourist spots help keep your confusion
              to a minimum when engaging on Bron Bron Land. <br />That is what
              makes this an example of Proximity.
