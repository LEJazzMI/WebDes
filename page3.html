        <h2>What's the meaning behind this?</h2>
        <br />
        <dl>
          <dt>REASON #1</dt>
          <dd>
            Akira Toriyama created Dragonball, the anime that paved way, and
            responsible for where anime is at present day.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>REASON #2</dt>
          <dd>
            Akira Toriyama essentially is the godfather of anime. He inspired
            the authors of One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach. <br />Then, the newer
            generations of anime are also inspired from these 3 anime, and also
            from Dragonball.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>REASON #3</dt>
          <dd>
            Many YouTubers who make Dragonball content are also inspired and had
            their lives changed because of Dragonball, whether animation,
            workout, life, and many more.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            <br />
            Big examples are: <br />Hyourinjutsu - One of, if not, the best in
            DB Pixel animation <br />SeeReax, Dotodoya, and Rhymestyle - Some of
            the leading DB YouTubers, together known as "The Three Idiots"<br />
            KSI - considered one of the biggest YouTubers who is known to be a
            huge fan of Dragonball,<br />
            and to be an inspiration for how far he's come now.
          </dd>
          <br />
          <dt>GENERAL REASON</dt>
          <dd>
            Akira Toriyama inspired millions of people in the world, especially
            in the animation industry, and almost the entirety of anime & its
            community. <br />
            He was essentially a father figure, and a role model to many, thanks
            to what he had done. <br />
            It is why such a tribute exists here. A moment of silence and
            appreciation to Akira Toriyama, who has now gone further beyond.
